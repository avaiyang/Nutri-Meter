# Nutri-Meter
In this day and age, where everyone is tracking all their steps we wanted to make something that will allow users to track all their nutrients and calorie intake and thats exactly what nutri meter does. 

The objective of our Nutri Meter webapp is to calculate the daily calorie intake of a user and along with that provide the nutrition information of the food. Moreover, the user is provided the option to chat with chatbot which can help the user to provide the recipe of any food item which the user wants.
